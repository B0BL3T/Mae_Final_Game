Game Description:
Press play to begin game. Use left and right arrows to control your space ship defending against endless waves of aliens. Each wave that is defeated is replaced with another wave that moves incrementally faster each wave. Aliens periodically drop bombs ,which are orange-red, down and the player must avoid them or else loose a life of which they start with 3. The goal of the game is to last for as long as possible against an unending hoard. Players recieve points for each alien destroyed and can compete by trying to improve their score between games. The main menu displays the all time high score. In addition to the regular bombs, the aliens have a chance to drop power ups, which are are purple and gives power to the player ship's railgun. For the next 10 seconds, the ship's drives glow blue and the player fires their railgun which pierce thru enemies to continue to destroy enemies above the initial victim. When hit by enemy bombs three times or when the aliens overrun the player and get past the ship, the game ends and the player looses.
